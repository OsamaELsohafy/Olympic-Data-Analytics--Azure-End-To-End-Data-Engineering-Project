![Project Overview](https://github.com/OsamaELsohafy/Olympic-Data-Analytics--Azure-End-To-End-Data-Engineering-Project/blob/main/Project%20Overview.png)

About the Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering solution built on the Azure cloud platform, focused on Olympic data analytics. It involves:

Data Ingestion: Azure Data Factory was used to pull data from multiple sources.
Data Storage: Raw data was stored in Azure Data Lake for scalable and secure data management.
Data Transformation: Azure Databricks was utilized for cleaning and transforming the data.
Data Loading: Transformed data was stored back in Azure Data Lake for future use.
Data Analysis: Azure Synapse Analytics enabled querying and generating insights from the processed data.
The project integrates key Azure services, providing a practical example of how to build a scalable data pipeline.
